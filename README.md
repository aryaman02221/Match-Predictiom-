# Match Prediction Algorithm
Welcome to my football match prediction model! As a huge football fan, I've combined my love for the sport with machine learning to build a predictive model that forecasts the outcome of football matches. This project explores the power of data-driven insights to anticipate match results, factoring in key variables that impact the game.

Features:
Predict match outcomes (Win/Loss/Draw) based on historical data
Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for predictions
Feature selection from player stats, team performance, and match conditions

Technologies Used:
Python üêç
Pandas, NumPy for data processing
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

Future Improvements:
Enhance model accuracy by incorporating live match data
Add support for predicting player performances and team strategies
Explore deeper neural network approaches
